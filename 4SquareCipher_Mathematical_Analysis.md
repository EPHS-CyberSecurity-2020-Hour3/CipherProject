# Mathmatical Analysis
Possibe keys
-------------------------
* One mixed box has 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000 possible keys for mixing its alphebet. If the second mixed box has a different key then amount is doubled.
--------------------------
My way of decrypting
---------------
* If I know it is a four square cipher, I would seperate the letters into groups of two and try to find common letters amoung the first letters and for the common letters in the second ones. After that I will try to use frequency analysis to see if there is any common letters or words.
----------------
Why its hard to decode
----------------
* It uses more then one key so it can frequency analysis a bit harder to use. Basically the same letter can be two different letters.
