# How It Works
### The cipher works by having multiple discs containing letters on the axle, allowing them to spin freely, the letters on the axle are the same for all of the m-94 machines, this acts as the decoder. The code works by spinning the discs until it forms your sentance that you want to say, this includes letters or numbers. Now that you have your message displayed on the discs, look above or below it or anywhere on the decoder. Write down the string of letters and numbers in a line. This is your encoded message, so your encryption key is that line of letters. TO uncode the message, simply enter in the string of letters and numbers, and look around on the encoder for text is clear to read, it should read you back your message that you wrote
