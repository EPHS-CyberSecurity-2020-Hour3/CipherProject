How many possible keys or codes could there be? How would you attempt to decode this message if you didn't have a key. What is the mathematical complexity to solve the code?

There are 312 possible keys

The Cypher is Created by making number letters

So A is 0 and B is 1 and so on until Z is 25

Example 

encryption of the plaintext “sail” using an affine cipher with encryption key (3,7)
produces ciphertext “JHFO” this way:

s −→ 18 −→ 3 · 18 + 7 ≡ 9 (mod 26) −→ J

a −→ 0 −→ 3 · 0 + 7 ≡ 7 (mod 26) −→ H

i −→ 8 −→ 3 · 8 + 7 ≡ 5 (mod 26) −→ F

l −→ 11 −→ 3 · 11 + 7 ≡ 14 (mod 26) −→ O
