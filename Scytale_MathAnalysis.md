# Math of Scytale

The scytale cipher is often represented as a square table.

       |   |   |   |   |   |  |
       | T | h | i | s | i |  |
     __| s | a | r | i | c |__|
    |  | k | r | o | l | l |
    |  | l | o | l | . |   |
    |  |   |   |   |   |   |
    
   
Each character get their own cell. The example above is a 5x4 (columns x rows). 
You could have as many rows as there are characters in the messages (spaces would be extraneous).
The same goes for the columns. Thus, if the message is x characters long, there can be x amounts of combinations.
