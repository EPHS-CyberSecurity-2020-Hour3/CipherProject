# Final Analysis

I would not use the atbash cipher to secure any important information. Maybe it was secure during a time in which a slight fraction of the population could read, much less write.
Perhaps if I were playing a game with children I would see how long it would take them to figure out what the message is, but other than that, it provides no real practical use.
