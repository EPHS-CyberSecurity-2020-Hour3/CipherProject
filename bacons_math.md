# Mathematical Analysis

There is only one possible key to bacon's cipher.

If I did not have a key I would split the message at every five letters then read those letters like binary then convert that to a decimal and then the decimal is the letter in the alphabet with 0 being A and 23 being Z.

This code is not at all mathematically complex to solve.
