# Pigpen Mechanics

The Pigpen Cipher is another example of a substitution cipher, but rather than replacing each letter with another letter, the letters are replaced by symbols. 

First you write out the whole alphabet in two grids like tik tak toe. Write two letter in each box starting with A,B in the top left and move along to the right. Each letter is represented by the part of the "pigpen" that surrounds it. If it's the second letter in the box, then it has a dot in the middle.

So an A looks like this: L
And a B looks like this: L.

## Encryption
The encryption process is fairly straightforward, replacing each occurence of a letter with the designated symbol. The symbols are assigned to the letters using any given key, where the letter shown is replaced by the part of the image in which it is located.

## Decryption
The decryption process is just the reverse of the encryption process. Using the same key, you locate the image depicted in the ciphertext, and replace it with the letter given by that part of the grid.
