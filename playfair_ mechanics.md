# Playfair Cipher Mechanics
The playfair cipher consists of a 5 by 5 grid which you use to encrypt your message

Things need to create a encrypted message...
* A key (a combination of letters)
* A 5x5 grid that is created by using the key
* Sort your plain text into groups of pairs while sets of 2 letters
  * Example: "this is a message" -> "th is is am es sa ge"
