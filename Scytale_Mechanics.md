# Mechanics of the Scytale Cypher

> The scytale cipher is very similar to the transposition cipher. The methods of encryption and decryption are the exact same. However neither are truly secure, as we estimate a low IQ is required to line up letters

### Encryption
wrap a ribbon around a cylinder and write your message across the ribbon

### Decryption
Wrap the ribbon around a cylinder of the same diameter as the one used to encrypt the message.
