## The Rail Fence Cipher Mechanics
### When the Rail Fence Cipher is encrypted is appears to be a single continuous line of jumbled text. This is because the text is not seperated into its different lines or "Rails" that the cipher is known for. To find the message you will need the key, which is the number of lines the cipher contains. Once the text is separated into the amount of lines the key provided, the message can then be read diagonally by going up and back down throughout the lines. 
### For the text "DEFEND THE EAST WALL" to be encrypted as a rail fence cipher it must first be separated into lines. The amount of lines you choose will become your key and it must be greater than 1 and less than the the amount of charatchers.

### Since the message did not fit exactly the two "X"'s were added as a placeholder. Then the lines must be written straight across without any spaces. So, the message "DEFEND THE EAST WALL" became the encrypted text "DNETLEEDHESWLXFTAAX"
