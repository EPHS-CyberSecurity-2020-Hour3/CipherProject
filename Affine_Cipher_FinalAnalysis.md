Why did this stop being a useful code? What made it useful when it was being used? What are other interesting uses of this code or similar codes?

The code stopped being as useful because it became easier and easier to crack just like the ceasar cypher. There is also a lack of possble keys, only 312 possble keys to guess from instead of thousands.

It was used as a way to encrypt messages bettwen software in 1980s which is kinda cool not used in a war but still pretty cool.

I thought it was intresting the in 1980s they went back and looked at the ceasar cypher and used the same consept it used.
