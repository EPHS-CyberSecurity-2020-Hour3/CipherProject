Why did this stop being a useful code? What made it useful when it was being used? What are other interesting uses of this code or similar codes?

The code stopped being as useful because it became easier and easier to crack just like the ceasar cypher. There is also a lack of possble keys, only 312 possble keys to guess from instead of thousands.
