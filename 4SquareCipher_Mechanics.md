# Mechanics
Setting up
------------
* There is four boxes needed for this cipher. The top left and bottem right should be regular boxes with a 5 by 5 of the letters of the alphabet in it with "i" and "j" combined. The other boxes are the same 5 by 5 boxes with mixed letters that are also using a key. Then get a text that you wna to encrypt and divide it into groups of two with one ltter and the one after that.
------------------------
Using it
---------------------
* You find the first letter of your text in the first of the regular alphebet boxes then the seconed letter in its group in the second regular alphebet box. Make those two locations the two opisite corners of a box outline and see the other corners made from that box outline. Now the encrypted text will be the real letter changed with the letter on the right/left corner of it of the random letter. Do this untill all of the groups of two letters are changed. If there is odd amount of letters then putt a random dummy letter at the end.
------------------
Decrypting
-----------------
* Decrypting works with this cipher by just using the random letters as the way to form the box frame and doing it the oppsite way.
