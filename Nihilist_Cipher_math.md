Theres alot of codes you can make with this cipher I dont know the exact amount though.

If I didn't have a key to decode the message it would be pretty hard to decode i could get multiple answewrs before getting the actual plaintext

The mathmetical complexity for this cipher isnt that hard becasue its just addition and subtraction.
