# Final analysis
When it was cracked
---------------
* It started to become more susceptible to being cracked through frequency analysis and comparing ciphertext fragments with fragments parts. This was able to be cracked but since its a four square cipher it took a lot more time then a plain text cipher. But it was completely cracked when computers became a thing and made the process a lot faster.
-----------------
When it was useful
----------------
* When it was made it was very useful because it got rid of the weaknesses of the ciphers that inspired it, like the the playfair cipher and two square cipher. This made the weakness of frequency analysis harder to use. It also took a lot more time when trying to crack it so it made people give up a lot more.
------------------
Other uses
---------------
* Since it is relatively hard to crack for regular people (also without the keys), you can use it for keeping any personal written down stuff from being discovered. For example passwords or very censoring specific words when writing in a diary.
