# Final Analysis
The book cipher was pretty useful while it was being used because it was somewhat secure. This method is relatively fine when the two people attempting to encrypt or decrypt messages with each other have had some sort of contact in person or have agreed upon a piece of text beforehand. Generally, this method was safe and secure at the time it was used, but would be too easy to crack in the modern age.
