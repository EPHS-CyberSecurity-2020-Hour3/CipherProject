I think that the Playfair cipher was unique because it was initailly requected after British government suggusted that it would be too hard to teach. Wheatstone later showed that it only takes 15 minutes to learn and was proved effective in both World War 1 and World War 2.

The effectiveness of the Playfair Cipher was due to its easiness to use and it requires no special equipment. As quoted by Wikipedia,"just requires a pencil and some paper" to operate the Playfair cipher.

The Playfair was used to protect important data, however, not top seceret data that played a critical part in the war. It would take hours to decode the message so by the time the message is decoded the information within the message will be useless. A typical example would be telling the troops to attact but by the time the enemy decoded the message it would be considered usless because they have already attacked.
