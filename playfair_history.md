I think that the Playfair cipher was unique because it was initailly requected after British government suggusted that it would be too hard to teach. Wheatstone later showed that it only takes 15 minutes to learn and was proved effective in both World War 1 and World War 2.

The effectiveness of the Playfair Cipher was due to its easiness to use and it requires no special equipment. As quoted by Wikipedia,"just requires a pencil and some paper" to operate the Playfair cipher.
