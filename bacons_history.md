# History

Bacons cipher otherwise know as the Baconian cipher was first devised by Francis Bacon in 1605. Francis Bacon was the lord chancellor of England under James I. The cipher was first written with the latin alphabet so I and J had the same value and also U and V had the same value. One interesting thing i found out was that it was believed that Francis Bacon wrote the shakespeare plays so people started looking into the plays trying to find if he used his cipher and a teacher found out that Queen Elizabeth I was Francis's mother but this theory of Francis writing the shakespeare plays has been refuted but the possibility still remains.
