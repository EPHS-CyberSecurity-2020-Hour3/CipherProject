Scytale Ciphers are composed of a rod and leather on the outside. The length of the cipher determined how it was to be encrypted and decrypted. 
Scytale Ciphers were first mentioned by a dude named Archilochus in 7th Century BC. He was a Greek philosopher. However, it's first cryptographic use 
was by Apollonius of Rhodes. They are notably similar to tranposition ciphers, encryption and decryption are quite similar. 

Quoted by Plutarch (A Greek philosopher and priest)

> The dispatch-scroll is of the following character. When the ephors send out an admiral or a general, 
> they make two round pieces of wood exactly alike in length and thickness, so that each corresponds to the other in its dimensions, 
> and keep one themselves, while they give the other to their envoy. These pieces of wood they call scytalae. 
> Whenever, then, they wish to send some secret and important message, they make a scroll of parchment long and narrow,
> like a leathern strap, and wind it round their scytale, leaving no vacant space thereon, but covering its surface all round with the parchment. 
> After doing this, they write what they wish on the parchment, just as it lies wrapped about the scytale; and when they have written their message,
> they take the parchment off and send it, without the piece of wood, to the commander. He, when he has received it, 
> cannot otherwise get any meaning out of it,--since the letters have no connection, but are disarranged,
> --unless he takes his own scytale and winds the strip of parchment about it, so that, when its spiral course is restored perfectly,
> and that which follows is joined to that which precedes, he reads around the staff, and so discovers the continuity of the message.
> And the parchment, like the staff, is called scytale, as the thing measured bears the name of the measure.

It had great use in the military of the Greeks. However there is no evidence that the Scytale was very effective and wasn't decrypted.
