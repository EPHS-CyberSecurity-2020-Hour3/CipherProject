# Mechanics: 
## Encryption Key:
The encryption key is the agreed upon piece of text. 
## Encryption: 
3 Ways
1. replacing each plaintext word with a word number from the book (most common)
* Index the word from 1- the end of the word
* the letter is coded by the number of the word starting with the same letter
2. replacing each letter in plaintext with a letter, word, or number
3. replacing each word in plaintext with a page number
## Decryption: 
Reverse encryption methods.
1. Replace the word number from the work with each plaintext word. (most common)
2. replace the letter, word, or number with each letter in plaintext. 
3. Use the page number to find the plaintext word. 
## Example: 
### Method 1

* T  a  b  l e
