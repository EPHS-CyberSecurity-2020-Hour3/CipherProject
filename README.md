# Playfair Cipher


#### Historical context
  When was this cipher used? Who used it?
[History](https://github.com/EPHS-CyberSecurity-2020-Hour3/CipherProject/blob/playfair_cipher/playfair_history.md)
#### Mechanics
  How does the cipher work?
  Demo an encryption and decryption
  Is it symmetric, does the same process decrypt as encrypt?
