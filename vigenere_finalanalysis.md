# Vingenere Final analysis

> This code is still useful but not being used very often.

> It was used for encryption in the 16th century.

> There were not any interesting uses for it other than to hide messages at the time.

## Do a Vigenere Yourself

> This is going go to be a step by step guide to creating your own Vigenere cipher:
1. Find a keyword
2. Repeat the keyword until it is the same length as the plaintext
3. Find your plaintext letter on the left hand side of the table
4. Find the corresponding letter in the keyword and find it at the top of the table
5. Draw straight lines from the letter on the table
6. Find the letter where the two lines cross
7. That is the encrypted letter
8. Repeat for every plaintext letter

## This is how you can Decrypte it Yourself

>This depicts the decyption of a Vigener cipher in a step by step manner:
1. Repeat the keyword until it is the same length as the cipher text
2. Find the keyword letter at the top of the table
3. Draw a line downwards until it is on the cipher text letter
4. Look at the same line as the cipher letter to the left hand side of the table
5. The letter on the left side of the table that is on the same height as the cipher letter is the plaintext letter
6. Repeat for every cipher letter
