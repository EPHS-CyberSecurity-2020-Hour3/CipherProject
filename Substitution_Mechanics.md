substitution involves a keyword replacing the first letters of the alphabet, then writing the rest of the alphabet.
##Example
Keyword: Run
Plaintext:  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Ciphertext: RUNABCDEFGHIJKLMOPQSTVWXYZ
Message:   I need to go get eggs from the store
Encrypted: F KBBA SL DL DBS BDDQ CPLJ SEB QSLPB
