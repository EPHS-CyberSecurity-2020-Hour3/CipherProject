# History of The Rail Fence Cipher
## The Rail Fence Cipher Was first used by the Ancient Greeks. They invented it with a tool they named scytale, which is composed of a ribbon and a cylinder. The ribbon was wrapped around the cylinder, so that the encoded message on the ribon would line up in a readable way. This was not very secure because all someone would need to discover the message was to wrap the ribbon around a cylinder with a similar diameter. The Rail Fence cipher was also used by both sides of the US Civil War as a field cipher. Modern day Rail Fence Ciphers are more secure than the Ancient Greeks and no longer use a cylinder and ribbon, but instead are encrypted as a single line of text that to be understood must be seperated into different lines and then read diagonally. The key of a modern Rail Fence cipher is the amount of lines it will contain.
