#History of The Rail Fence Cipher
##The Rail Fence Cipher Was first used by the Ancient Greeks. They invented it with a tool composed of a ribbon and a cylinder they named scytale. The ribbon was wrapped around a cylinder of a specific size so that the encoded message on the ribon would line up in a readable way. This was not very secure because all someone would need to discover the message is a cylinder of a similar diameter. The Rail Fence cipher was also used by both sides of the US Civil War as a field cipher. Modern day Rail Fence Ciphers are more secure than the Ancient Greeks and no longer use a cylinder and ribbon, but instead are encrypted in a single line and to be understood they must be seperated into different line and then read diagonally. The key of a modern Rail Fence cipher is the amount of lines it will contain.
