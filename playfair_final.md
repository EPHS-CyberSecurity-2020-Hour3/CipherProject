# Playfair Final Analysis
##### The ciper was effective at a point, however, today would be considered insecure due to the fast computers and advanced cryptography
Why did this stop being a useful code?
What made it useful when it was being used?
What are other interesting uses of this code or similar codes?

Overall, this code stopped being useful once we discover how to use frequency analysis to crack the key used. However, it was still being used up until WW2 after that point I would consider it to be useless except for students wanting to learn about different ciphers.

Even though this cipher is currently consider un-secure, it served as a great cipher in both of the World Wars. In WW2, it was still crackable, however, it took a couple hours. Knowing this the Allies used it to encrypt messages that would be rendered useless in a couple hours. I think it is cool that a cipher had such a big effect on the biggest war of all time. :+1:
