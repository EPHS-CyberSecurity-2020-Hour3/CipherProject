In book ciphers, it's important to make sure that both the sender and the reciever of the book cipher have the same book and the same edition of the book. It would be a lot harder to solve the cipher if you didn't have the right book as the sender!

There isn't a specific number of the possible keys or codes as it depends on how many pages, sheets and columns each book has. Also, the mathematical complexity of this cipher is not to high looking at how book ciphers aren't considered to be secure.
