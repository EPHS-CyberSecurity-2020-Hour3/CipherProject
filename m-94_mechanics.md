## The Cipher consists of 25 discs, with random letters placed on a solid axle, the discs are able to be rotated to encrypt a message
## Messages were encrypted 25 letters at a time, and were lined up horizontally and the code messages would be written down by reading another one of the other lines, and to unscramble the decoder would be enformed of the key and enter in the coded messages and the text would appear on one of the lines, you needed the cipher to read the hidden messages
## "ATTACK AT DAWN." One possible ciphertext is "CMWD SMXX KEIL."
