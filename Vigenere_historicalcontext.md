 # Historical Context Of Vigenere Cipher
 
 ## Creator 
 > The creator of this type of cipher, as you guessed, Blaise de Vigenere. He was a 16th century cryptographer. During his life he was in civil service, and he also accompanied a Duke and a French envoy. Most importantly, he worked as a secretary for Henry III, the King. He encountered cryptography during his trips to Rome while working as with the French envoy. During those trips he got inspired and decided to learn cryptography at home. After a few years, he developped the Vigenere technique.

 ## The Cipher
 > The cipher itself is a type of substitution cipher used to encode plaintext. This method has a long history and was already known before Vigenere. For many year this cipher developped by Vigenere was known as the *le chiffre ind√©chiffrable*, litteraly translates to the unbreakable code.
