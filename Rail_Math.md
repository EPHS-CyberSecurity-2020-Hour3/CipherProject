To solve this cipher without the key you need to know the height and cycle of the cipher.  The height is the number of fence rails used and the cycle is found be the equation.  

Cycle = ([#of rails]*2)-2

The mathematical complexity of this cipher is not very complex because all you have to do is put numbers into the equations.
