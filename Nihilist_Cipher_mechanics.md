how the nhilist cipher works is

this is how you encrypt

1. create a polybius square
2. the key to encrypt the plaintext
3. the plaintext to encrypt

this is how to decrypt

1. subtraact the key from the plaintext
2. using the numbers locate them on the polybuis square

heres an example 

![polybuis square](https://www.boxentriq.com/img/tap-code-square-520x340.png)

key = one
plaintext = jeff

o = 34
n = 33
e = 15

j = 25
e = 15
f = 21
f = 21

now you wanna add these together to encrypt them

 25, 15, 21, 21
+34, 33, 15, 34
=59, 48, 36, 55

to decrypt you wanna use the same polybuis square

 59, 48, 36, 55
-34, 33, 15, 34
=25, 15, 21, 21

25 = j
15 = e
21 = f
21 = f

then we get the plaintext of jeff
