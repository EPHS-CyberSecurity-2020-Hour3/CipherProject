# Final Analysis
Bacon's Cipher is not used anymore because it is a substitution cipher and therefore very easy to crack.  
The cipher was made in 1605 so it was rather complex for the time period so that made it kind of useful. Also it can be used for something simple like if you just want to send a private message to someone or jsut write something down you dont want your siblings to see the cipher should not be used for something complex like nuclear launch codes.
