# Mathematical Analysis
> The table consists of the alphabets written out 26 times in different rows, each alphabet shifted cyclically to the left compared to the previous alphabet, corresponding to the 26 possible Caesar Ciphers.

## In Depth
> Using the logic that was explained above, there are 26 ways to encrypt a letter, corresponding to the alphabet, that means that for a 7 letter word there are approximatively 7 billion ways to encrypt it. That let's conclude that brute force is not the favorable method to crack these. This also explains why this was the most uncrackable code for almost 300 years.

## How to Decrypt
> The way cryptographers nowadays decrypt this cipher is using CRIBS, which are words that are commonly used in a language that are sometimes repeated even in the cipher text. Using that method, they can easily break the cipher once they figured out the length of the key. However, figuring out the length of the key can be a task on its own. Cryptographers have to the Kasiski examination, which is the process of identifying repetitions in the cipher text and measuring the space between them. From there, they can find the length of the key. After finding that length, they can easily figure out the plain text.
